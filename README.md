In these repository I gonna post the solutions for "Advent of Code 2020" project tasks.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

### Some key elements of my coding adventure:
- I use python, every file is dedicated to solving 1 day tasks (so, 2 tasks per day/file)
- I try to spend not more then 60 min per day for the tasks (that affects quality, but everything has a downside)
  - from about day 7 it became clear that tasks are not doable in 60 min for me anymore
  - from day 8 I startet to post my "dirty" code with intention to clean it later
- I do not copy the input data into repository and mostly use pyperclip python library to upload data directly from the clipboard 

### Special thanks for ideas
- For Day3 task I used an idea from Leli for using Modulus operator. Check [Leli](https://github.com/lelilia)'s page
- For Day8 I have to thank [Leli](https://github.com/lelilia) and [Kristian](https://github.com/krother) for reminding about deepcopy concept
