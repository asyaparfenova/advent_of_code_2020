In these repository I gonna post the solutions for "Advent of Code 2020" project tasks.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I use python, every file is dedicated to solving 1 day tasks (so, 2 tasks per day/file)

### Special thanks for ideas
- For Day3 task I used an idea from Leli for using Modulus operator. Check [Leli](https://github.com/lelilia)'s page.
